# Day 2: Advanced Prompting and Chains

## Overview
This module focuses on advanced techniques in prompt engineering and chain composition in LangChain.

## Learning Objectives
1. Master different types of prompt templates
2. Understand and implement few-shot learning
3. Explore chain of thought prompting
4. Work with different chain types (sequential, parallel, custom)
5. Build a text summarizer with different styles

## Project Structure
- `advanced_prompting.py`: Examples of different prompt engineering techniques
- `chain_types.py`: Demonstrations of different chain patterns
- `text_summarizer.py`: Project implementing a text summarizer with different styles
- `day2_summary.md`: Progress tracking and key learnings

## Key Concepts
1. **Advanced Prompting**
   - Few-shot learning examples
   - Chain of thought prompting
   - Different prompt template types
   - Prompt optimization techniques

2. **Chain Types**
   - Sequential chains
   - Parallel chains
   - Custom chains
   - Chain composition patterns

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have completed Day 1 materials
2. Review the basic concepts in each file
3. Follow the examples and exercises
4. Complete the text summarizer project

## Project: Text Summarizer
The final project will be a text summarizer that can:
- Generate different types of summaries (concise, detailed, technical)
- Use different prompting techniques
- Implement various chain patterns
- Handle different input formats
