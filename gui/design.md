# AI Assistant Design Document

## Core Components

### 1. Chat System
- AI assistant powered by GPT-4o-mini
- Memory system maintaining last 5 conversation rounds
- Instruction management system similar to .cursorrules
- Streamlit-based GUI

### 2. Key Features

#### Memory Management
- Store and maintain last 5 conversation rounds
- Include previous context in each new interaction
- Potential enhancement: Summarization for older context

#### Instruction System
- `instruction.md` file as central configuration
- Instructions included in each context
- Scratchpad section for bot's notes
- LLM-accessible tool for file updates
- Version tracking for file changes

#### GUI Components
- Built with Streamlit
- instruction.md displayed in sidebar
- Chat interface in main area
- All implementation under `/gui` directory

### 3. Project Structure
```
/gui
├── app.py              # Main Streamlit application
├── instruction.md      # Instructions and scratchpad
├── components/
│   ├── chat.py        # Chat interface component
│   ├── memory.py      # Memory management
│   └── file_tools.py  # File manipulation tools
└── utils/
    ├── llm.py         # LLM configuration and setup
    └── config.py      # Configuration management
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Security
- Implement safeguards for file modification tools
- Validation system for instruction.md updates
- Rate limiting for file modifications
- Input sanitization

### Performance
- Streamlit caching implementation
- Batch updates for instruction.md
- Efficient context management
- Memory optimization strategies

### Memory System Enhancements
- Hybrid memory system for important information retention
- Context summarization for token management
- Priority-based memory retention
- Configurable memory timeframes

### Instruction Management
- Structured scratchpad sections
- Timestamp tracking for changes
- Categories for different types of notes
- Version control integration
