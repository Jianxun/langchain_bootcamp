This provides a convenient solution when interfacing with ADCs. Differential outputs allow twice the output signal of conventional amplifiers, to get the most signal on low supplies."

Our technology supports clock synchronization with common standards, including 1 pulse per second (PPS) output signal from a GPS receiver. GPS signals are broadly available and utilize an extremely stable atomic clock as its time base, but they are often noisy. Systems rely on the IEEE1588 timing protocol to establish synchronous communications across the wired network, including synchronous Ethernet and synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) to optical transport network (OTN) mapping/demapping. The IEEE1588 protocol has emerged as the preferred method for Clock synchronizing systems throughout both computer networks and local area networks (LAN)."

Time to market is significantly reduced by taking advantage of this highly integrated solution with in-package circuitry and enhanced isolation that attenuate spurious components. Analog Devices translation loop solutions provide a frequency synthesis solution for engineers designing highly competitive systems.\n\nAnalog Devices’ offset loop devices require an external Phase and Frequency Detector (PFD) and an external local oscillator (LO) to form a frequency synthesis solution. The solutions provide instrument grade performance in a small form factor.\n\nAnalog Devices translation loops implement an integrated down-conversion mixing stage in the feedback loop. This sets the loop gain to 1 and minimizes the in-band phase noise. By combining the frequency down-conversion stage and Analog Devices’ lowest noise integrated wideband VCO technology, these solutions offer sub-10fs rms wideband jitter performance. The output jitter performance is largely dependent on the performance of the external offset LO."

These isolated gate drivers leverage ADI’s proven iCoupler isolation technology combined with high speed CMOS and monolithic transformer technology to enable ultralow propagation delay without sacrificing common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) performance.

The Schottky diode bridge rectifier is a classic circuit used for full-wave ac-to-dc rectification and dc polarity correction. Due to the ~0.6 V drop of each diode, the two diodes in the I/O path dissipate power (1.2 W per ampere), radiate heat, raise the ambient temperature, and complicate thermal design. At low input voltages, the two diode drops significantly reduce the voltage available to the downstream dc-to-dc converter. Ideal diode bridges eliminate or reduce heat sinking requirements, which helps shrink the overall footprint and provides significant cost savings."

A proprietary 4-switch PWM buck-boost topology provides low noise, jitter-free switching through all operating modes, making them ideal for RF and precision analog applications that are sensitive to power supply noise. With their unique internal four MOSFET switch combination, they can seamlessly transition from step-down mode, through 100% dropout operation, and then to step-up mode to allow a fixed output voltage even when the input voltage fluctuates above or below the output. Some devices may be paralleled for higher power delivery, or include automatic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for solar battery charging and MPPT control functions."

DDR and QDR memories require three voltage rails: bus supply voltage (VDD), bus termination voltage (VTT), and reference voltage (VREF). The bus termination voltage (VTT) and reference voltage (VREF) must track to ½ bus supply voltage (VDD), and the bus termination voltage (VTT) also requires a current sink and source function. Our portfolio of DDR/QDR memory bus termination products supports the powering needs of i.MX, PXA, ARM, OMAP, and other advanced microprocessors, offering voltage-mode and current-mode switching regulator topologies, very low input voltages, adjustable switching frequency operation, and ultra-thin packaging."

Analog Devices’ proprietary iCoupler® technology is integrated in several forward controllers, which eliminates bulky signal transformers and optocouplers that transmit signals over the isolation boundary. Many of the flyback controllers do not need an optocoupler, which reduces design complexity and cost, while improving overall system reliability. Several off-the-shelf transformers for both topologies are shown in the product data sheets, which further simplifies the design and allows for the fastest time to market."

Time to market is significantly reduced by taking advantage of this highly integrated solution with in-package circuitry and enhanced isolation that attenuate spurious components. Analog Devices translation loop solutions provide a frequency synthesis solution for engineers designing highly competitive systems.\n\nAnalog Devices’ offset loop devices require an external Phase and Frequency Detector (PFD) and an external local oscillator (LO) to form a frequency synthesis solution. The solutions provide instrument grade performance in a small form factor.\n\nAnalog Devices translation loops implement an integrated down-conversion mixing stage in the feedback loop. This sets the loop gain to 1 and minimizes the in-band phase noise. By combining the frequency down-conversion stage and Analog Devices’ lowest noise integrated wideband VCO technology, these solutions offer sub-10fs rms wideband jitter performance. The output jitter performance is largely dependent on the performance of the external offset LO."

The logarithmic “linear in dB” response, changing the output voltage by the same amount for every dB change in true RF input power, enables accurate wide dynamic range measurement of complex, high-crest factor waveforms. An accurate digital representation can be obtained through interfacing with only a moderate resolution analog-to-digital converter. The combination of wide dynamic range and TruPwr™ measurement finds use in a wide range of applications, such as various types of wireless communications systems, instrumentation and measurement equipment, military equipment and much more."

The video driver is typically configured as an active filter, also known as a reconstruction or anti-imaging filter. The purpose of the reconstruction filter is twofold: it blocks the higher frequency components (above the Nyquist frequency) that were introduced into the video signal as part of the digitization process and provides gain to drive the external 75 Ω cable to the video display."
