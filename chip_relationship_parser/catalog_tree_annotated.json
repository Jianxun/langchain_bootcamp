Time to market is significantly reduced by taking advantage of this highly integrated solution with in-package circuitry and enhanced isolation that attenuate spurious components. Analog Devices translation loop solutions provide a frequency synthesis solution for engineers designing highly competitive systems.\n\nAnalog Devices\u2019 offset loop devices require an external Phase and Frequency Detector (PFD) and an external local oscillator (LO) to form a frequency synthesis solution. The solutions provide instrument grade performance in a small form factor.\n\nAnalog Devices translation loops implement an integrated down-conversion mixing stage in the feedback loop. This sets the loop gain to 1 and minimizes the in-band phase noise. By combining the frequency down-conversion stage and Analog Devices\u2019 lowest noise integrated wideband VCO technology, these solutions offer sub-10fs rms wideband jitter performance.

Due to the ~0.6 V drop of each diode, the two diodes in the I/O path dissipate power (1.2 W per ampere), radiate heat, raise the ambient temperature, and complicate thermal design. At low input voltages, the two diode drops significantly reduce the voltage available to the downstream dc-to-dc converter.

Due to the number of advantages supercapacitors have, such as lower effective series resistance (ESR) and enhanced durability in the face of repeated charging, they are an increasingly important alternative to batteries in applications where the importance of power delivery trumps that of total energy storage.",

Analog Devices\u2019 proprietary iCoupler\u00ae technology is integrated in several forward controllers, which eliminates bulky signal transformers and optocouplers that transmit signals over the isolation boundary. Many of the flyback controllers do not need an optocoupler, which reduces design complexity and cost, while improving overall system reliability.

Our technology supports clock synchronization with common standards, including 1 pulse per second (PPS) output signal from a GPS receiver. GPS signals are broadly available and utilize an extremely stable atomic clock as its time base, but they are often noisy. Systems rely on the IEEE1588 timing protocol to establish synchronous communications across the wired network, including synchronous Ethernet and synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) to optical transport network (OTN) mapping/demapping. The IEEE1588 protocol has emerged as the preferred method for Clock synchronizing systems throughout both computer networks and local area networks (LAN).",

Now you can easily log the thermal exposure of an asset during shipment to see if it stays within specified temperature ranges. Thermochron data loggers make it simple and inexpensive to monitor anything that is temperature sensitive, including pharmaceuticals (vaccines, drugs, reagents), fresh or frozen foods (fruits, vegetables, dairy/dessert products), biological items (animals, blood products, soil), or heating/refrigeration/freezer systems. The Thermochron data logger can also be used for warranty-tracking purposes on equipment that must be kept within a certain temperature range, or to log the results of a process that must be monitored for compliance to a temperature profile. Like all iButton devices, the stainless-steel casing of a Thermochron data logger makes it rugged, reusable, and portable.

Now you can easily log the thermal exposure of an asset during shipment to see if it stays within specified temperature ranges. Thermochron data loggers make it simple and inexpensive to monitor anything that is temperature sensitive, including pharmaceuticals (vaccines, drugs, reagents), fresh or frozen foods (fruits, vegetables, dairy/dessert products), biological items (animals, blood products, soil), or heating/refrigeration/freezer systems. The Thermochron data logger can also be used for warranty-tracking purposes on equipment that must be kept within a certain temperature range, or to log the results of a process that must be monitored for compliance to a temperature profile. Like all iButton devices, the stainless-steel casing of a Thermochron data logger makes it rugged, reusable, and portable. It is so small that it fits anywhere and can deliver years of reliable, highly accurate temperature readings.",

The purpose of the reconstruction filter is twofold: it blocks the higher frequency components (above the Nyquist frequency) that were introduced into the video signal as part of the digitization process and provides gain to drive the external 75 \u2126 cable to the video display.",
