Hereâ€™s a **7-day LangChain learning plan** with projects that gradually increase in difficulty. It assumes familiarity with Python and basic LLM concepts. Each project introduces a new LangChain feature or concept, building towards more complex applications.  

---

### **Day 1: Getting Started with LangChain**  
**Project:** *Simple LLM-Powered Chatbot*  
- Use `langchain.llms` to interact with OpenAI/GPT models.  
- Create a basic chatbot that takes user input and returns LLM-generated responses.  
- Learn how to set parameters like temperature and max tokens.  
- **Concepts:** `LLM`, `PromptTemplate`, basic LangChain setup.  

---

### **Day 2: Prompt Engineering & Chains**  
**Project:** *AI-Powered Text Summarizer*  
- Build a tool that takes long text and summarizes it.  
- Experiment with different prompt templates to generate concise vs. detailed summaries.  
- Use `LLMChain` to create a structured workflow.  
- **Concepts:** `PromptTemplate`, `LLMChain`, input/output customization.  

---

### **Day 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
**Project:** *Document Q&A System*  
- Load a PDF/text document and allow users to ask questions about it.  
- Use `VectorStore` and embeddings to retrieve relevant context before answering.  
- **Concepts:** `DocumentLoader`, `TextSplitter`, `VectorStore`, `RetrievalQA`.  

---

### **Day 4: Agent-Based Workflows**  
**Project:** *AI Assistant with Multiple Tools*  
- Build an agent that can answer questions, perform calculations, and fetch data from APIs.  
- Use LangChain tools like `WikipediaAPIWrapper` and `MathChain`.  
- **Concepts:** `Agents`, `Tools`, `AgentExecutor`.  

---

### **Day 5: Memory & Context Handling**  
**Project:** *Conversational AI with Memory*  
- Extend the chatbot from Day 1 to remember past interactions.  
- Use `ConversationBufferMemory` or `ConversationSummaryMemory` to track context.  
- **Concepts:** `Memory`, `ConversationalRetrievalChain`, session-based context retention.  

---

### **Day 6: Multi-Step Workflows & Automation**  
**Project:** *AI-Powered Research Assistant*  
- Given a query, the assistant searches multiple sources, summarizes information, and generates a report.  
- Integrate search APIs or web scraping.  
- Combine multiple chains into a structured workflow.  
- **Concepts:** `SequentialChain`, `ParallelChain`, external API integration.  

---

### **Day 7: Deployment & Scaling**  
**Project:** *Deploy a LangChain App with Streamlit*  
- Deploy one of the previous projects as a web app using Streamlit.  
- Implement user input forms, real-time updates, and interactive UI elements.  
- **Concepts:** `Streamlit`, API hosting, user interaction.
