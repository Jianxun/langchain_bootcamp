The integration of the photodiode and AFE also provides high ambient light rejection and wide dynamic range to better reduce false alarms.\n\nAn integrated optical design greatly simplifies the optical design and offers significant system enhancements.\n\nOur solution uses a Mie scattering approach with closer proximity of the LED to the photodiode. This reduces circuit board size and allows for smaller smoke detectors that are more architecturally compatible for residential and commercial use. It also offers an easier supply chain because the whole solution is manufactured, tested, and verified by us. This significantly reduces the risk to the customer. The Accumold 28800X smoke chamber was developed in partnership with Analog Devices and tuned to the ADPD188BI smoke sensor to offer the complete optical sub-system solution for smoke detectors.\nWe have also developed a smoke detector reference design including UL 217 test data set and an algorithm designed and tested to meet UL requirements, accelerating development cycles, and reducing cost and project risk.",
